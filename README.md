# PHP Task: Temperature Conversion.
Temperature is usually measured in either **Celsius (°C)**, **Fahrenheit (°F)**, **Kelvin (°K)** or even **Rankine (°R)**.

_Rankine is an uncommon unit for measuring temperature, however it is still used._

Below are the formulas used in converting temperatures in celsius from one unit to another.

Celsius to Fahrenheit: 
f = c × 9/5 + 32

Celsius to Kelvin: 
k = c+ 273.15

Celsius to Rankine: 
r = c + 273.15) × 9/5

You are given the below variable $c (4°C), which is in Celsius. You are asked to convert this value, into Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Rankine.

```
$c = 4;
```

Convert the above value into F, K and R, and print out the result onto a web page. The webpage should look like the following:
